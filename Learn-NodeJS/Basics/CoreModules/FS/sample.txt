Server-side rendering (SSR) means that the server generates the complete HTML content of a web page and sends it to the client (usually a web browser). 
The server executes the code, fetches data from databases or APIs, and generates the HTML with the data included. 
The client receives the pre-rendered HTML and displays it to the user. This approach is often used in traditional web applications.

Client-side rendering (CSR), on the other hand, means that the server sends a minimal HTML file to the client, usually containing the basic structure of the page and some JavaScript code.
 The client's web browser then executes the JavaScript code, which fetches data from the server, manipulates the HTML structure, and renders the final content dynamically. 
 This approach is often used in modern single-page applications (SPAs) and allows for a more interactive and dynamic user experience.
